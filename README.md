## What is this?
This project takes PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10.0 measurements from a PMSA003I particulate sensor and provides them to HomeKit for display on iOS and macOS devices without the need for an additional bridge.

## Parts
- [Adafruit PMSA003I Air Quality Breakout - STEMMA QT / Qwiic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4632)
- [SparkFun Thing Plus - ESP32 WROOM (USB-C)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/20168)
- [Flexible Qwiic Cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17260)

## Wiring
- They weren't lying when they named it 'Qwiic' - just connect the ESP32 to the sensor breakout via the cable.

## iOS
